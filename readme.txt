Club Puffle is a simulated virtual world that is based off the popular online kids’ game, Club Penguin. A feisty boss has taken Purple Puffle’s friend, Blue Puffle, away and it’s up to Purple Puffle to save the day by defeating the boss. 

There are three primary modes: Fight Mode (to defeat the boss), Train Mode (to increase the stats of Purple Puffle, to facilitate defeating the boss in Fight Mode), and Rest Mode (to restore HP). 

I used Pygame to make this program, which you can find more information about at http://pygame.org/hifi.html. You can launch this program through a Python-supported IDE. 

I used this document to download Pygame on my Mac: https://docs.google.com/a/andrew.cmu.edu/document/d/1QcB0qzut3PsWtmUa_moXezTymLmumvwnTQjcmWxcPgY/edit?usp=sharing.
